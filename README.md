# PromptProof

Why do I need to use this prompt before starting a new AI session?

"Hic sunt dracones"

Introduction: Yes, there are thousands of "AI's best top 100 prompts" list. This is not one. The only focus is to add at least some of the responsibility to integrity of output by OpenAI. A secondary goal is to reduce overall tokens used for any API call. 

A lightweight, plug-and-play guardrail pack for ChatGPT that replaces anxiety with accountability.

Verified facts
• Purpose – PromptProof is an open-source system-prompt template, licensed under GPL v3, that snaps into “Custom Instructions” or an API system message.
• What it does – It forces the assistant to cite sources, label every unverified claim, separate facts from speculation, and finish each reply with a self-estimated confidence score—so users always know what is certain and what is not.
• Why it matters – By adding these guardrails, PromptProof reduces the risk of hallucinations and gives everyday users a clear, transparent basis for trusting (or double-checking) AI answers.
• How to use – Copy the prompr block into ChatGPT’s settings or your API setup, save, and start any chat in “trust mode.” No extra software or coding is required.
