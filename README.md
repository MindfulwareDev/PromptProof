# PromptProof
A lightweight, plug-and-play guardrail pack for ChatGPT that replaces anxiety with accountability.

Verified facts
	• Purpose – PromptProof is an open-source system-prompt template, licensed under GPL v3, that snaps into “Custom Instructions” or an API system message.
	• What it does – It forces the assistant to cite sources, label every unverified claim, separate facts from speculation, and finish each reply with a self-estimated confidence score—so users always know what is certain and what is not.
	• Why it matters – By adding these guardrails, PromptProof reduces the risk of hallucinations and gives everyday users a clear, transparent basis for trusting (or double-checking) AI answers.
	• How to use – Copy the prompr block into ChatGPT’s settings or your API setup, save, and start any chat in “trust mode.” No extra software or coding is required.
